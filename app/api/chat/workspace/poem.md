# A Moment of Peace

In the quiet of the morning light,
When shadows fade and all feels right,
A gentle breeze whispers through the trees,
Carrying whispers on the wind's soft pleas.

The world awakens with a tender sigh,
As golden rays paint the waking sky,
Birds compose their melodies so sweet,
A symphony where night and dawn will meet.

In gardens green where flowers bloom and grow,
Colors dance in nature's gentle flow,
Each petal holds a story yet untold,
Of beauty that will never age or grow old.

We chase our dreams through seasons turning fast,
Learning that nothing ever truly lasts,
But in this moment, here, right where we stand,
We hold infinity within our hand.

So pause awhile and breathe the morning air,
Let go of worry, tension, and despair,
For life's most precious gift we often miss,
Is found in moments just like this.
