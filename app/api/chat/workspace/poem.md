# A Moment of Wonder

Beneath the canvas of the starlit sky,
Where dreams take flight and spirits fly,
A gentle breeze whispers through the night,
Painting the world in silver light.

The moon hangs low, a guardian's gaze,
Watching over forest's maze,
Where ancient trees stand tall and true,
Holding secrets of the morning dew.

In quiet moments, hearts find peace,
When worries fade and tensions cease,
The universe reveals its grace,
In every soul, in every place.

So let us pause and breathe it in,
This magic that dwells deep within,
For life's a poem, verse by verse,
Both blessing and a gentle curse.

And in the end, we understand,
That love and hope, forever planned,
Are the true words that set us free,
In poetry's sweet symphony.
